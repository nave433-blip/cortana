"""Selectable assistant personalities for Cortana.

Each personality is a named system-prompt profile. The active personality is
stored in config under ``personality`` (default ``"cortana"``) and can be
changed with ``/personality <name>`` in the REPL, ``cortana personality
<name>`` on the CLI, or the dashboard/GUI picker.

Legacy personality keys from earlier releases (``sarcastic``, ``concise``,
``mentor``, ``nave_ai``) keep working as aliases so old configs don't break.

Security note: personality prompts are tone/style only. They must never
contain refusal-bypass content (see ``test_personality_no_refusal_bypass``
in the test suite, mirroring the audit regression pins).
