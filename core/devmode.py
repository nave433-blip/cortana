"""Developer mode: local-only diagnostics and personal instructions.

Dev mode is a neutral mechanism for the developer's own machine. When
enabled it changes *visibility only*:

- DEBUG log level
- per-request timing plus which provider/model served each LLM call
- a clear DEV MODE banner at REPL startup
- optional personal instructions appended to the system prompt, loaded from
  ``~/.jarvis/dev_instructions.md`` — a file that lives outside the repo and
  is never committed

It never changes tool-execution semantics: no new capabilities, no bypassed
confirmations, no altered safety behavior. The contents of the personal
instructions file are the developer's own business; this loader never logs
or prints them.
