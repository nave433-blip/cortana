# CORTANA: The Ultimate Proactive AI Assistant (v0.2.6)

CORTANA is a proactive AI engineering assistant that runs locally on macOS and Linux. It combines high-speed technical reasoning with deep system control and multi-model aggregator capabilities.

## 🚀 What's New in v0.2.6

The audit-to-release arc — everything below was re-verified with
`compileall` clean and the full test suite green:

- **⏰ In-Cortana task scheduler** (`/schedule`) — persistent one-shot,
  interval, and cron jobs with whitelisted actions, atomic job storage
  (`0600`), and an append-only run log. No system cron needed:
  `/schedule add --name "nightly pull" --action "/ollama auto-pull" --cron "0 4 * * *"`.
- **🖥️ Local web dashboard** (`/dashboard` or `cortana dashboard`) —
  token-authenticated (per-instance token, `0600`, constant-time compare),
  stdlib-only, loopback by default (`--lan` binds LAN with a warning):
  live provider/P2P/Ollama/scheduler panels, safe chat, and a read-only
  command whitelist.
- **🐝 Hive mind, 🐜 agent swarm, 🔌 MCP, 🔎 deep research** — new
  subsystems with honest "unavailable" errors instead of fake stubs
  (`/hive`, `/swarm`, `/mcp`, `/research`).
- **🦙 Ollama fleet management** — `/ollama ps`, `prune`, `bench`,
  `stats`, multi-host pools, auto-pull with `/schedule` integration.
- **🧊 Thin client** — `/thin` for low-resource nodes against a fat peer.
- **⏳ Conversation time-travel** — `/rewind`, `/branch`, `/branches`, `/diff`.
- **📦 Verified skill sharing** — `/skill` packs are manifest-verified.
- **📋 Proactive briefs & 🤝 session handoff** — `/brief`, `/handoff`.
- **Hardening** — P2P TLS option, capability-flag service advertising,
  startup ≈12× faster (lazy LiteLLM/Paramiko imports with regression
  tests), actionable one-line errors instead of tracebacks, and a
  realistic filesystem MCP fixture for tests.

## 💎 Core Features
- **Multi-Model Aggregator:** Switch between **Ollama**, **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **Gemini**, **Mistral**, **DeepSeek**, **Groq**, and more.
- **Gemini-Style Interface:** Transparent reasoning blocks and Warp-inspired command input.
- **AI Tool Hub:** Native launchers for **Claude Code**, **Copilot CLI**, and **Hermes**.
- **Vector Memory:** Semantic context storage using FAISS and local embeddings.

## 📦 Installation

Pick one:

**1. One-line installer (Linux & macOS)** — sets up an isolated venv in `~/.cortana-app` and links the `cortana` command:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nave433-blip/jarvis-dev/main/install.sh | bash
```
What it does: installs system audio deps via your package manager (apt/dnf/pacman/zypper, or Homebrew on macOS — uses sudo), fetches the sources, creates a Python 3.12+ venv, installs `cortana` to `/usr/local/bin`, and smoke-tests it. Re-running updates safely.
Options: `CORTANA_SKIP_SYSTEM_DEPS=1` (skip the sudo step), `CORTANA_DIR=…` (custom location), `CORTANA_REF=…` (install a branch/tag).

**2. Homebrew (macOS & Linux)** — installs into a Homebrew-managed virtualenv (Python 3.12, portaudio, Ollama):
```bash
brew install --formula https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nave433-blip/jarvis-dev/main/cortana.rb
```

**3. pip / pipx** (any platform with Python 3.12+):
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nave433-blip/jarvis-dev.git
# or fully isolated:
pipx install git+https://github.com/nave433-blip/jarvis-dev.git
```

After connecting, run `cortana` and then `/connect` inside it to set up your AI providers.

## 🔌 Connecting your AI providers

Run the interactive setup wizard any time:

- `/connect` (interactive chat) or `connect-provider <name> [--host URL] [--key KEY]` (CLI)
- `/connections` (interactive chat) or `connections [--test]` (CLI) — status table for all 18 providers

The wizard lists every supported provider with a status dot (● configured / ○ not),
auto-detects a running **Ollama** (`GET http://localhost:11434/api/tags`, one-confirm setup,
opt-in auto-repair), and accepts a custom host for the other local providers
(vLLM, SGLang, GPT4All, llama.cpp, NVIDIA NeMo, Local server). For API-key providers
it shows the provider's key page URL and reads the key with hidden input.

Key storage: keys are validated **before** they are saved and live in the OS
keyring (service `cortana-dev`, account `cortana-<provider>`). If no keyring backend
is available, CORTANA falls back to `~/.cortana/keys.json` with `0600` permissions and
prints a clear warning that this is less secure. Keys are never printed, logged, or
echoed — the status table only shows set/not-set. Keys left in the old config-file
store are migrated into the keyring on first successful connect and removed from
the config file.

Validation is real: every provider is checked against a documented live endpoint
(never a "key present" fake), and a failed `/connections --test` tells you exactly
what to do next — e.g. a rejected key points at that provider's key page. The
wizard also labels legitimate free options it verified (Gemini, Groq, Mistral,
Cohere, Together, GitHub, and self-hosted local providers); paid-only providers
carry no free-tier claim rather than a guessed one.

## 📡 P2P swarm (opt-in)

CORTANA instances can link over the LAN: `p2p-server` starts your node, `p2p-scan`
finds peers, `p2p-status` shows the swarm, and (with your explicit per-action
approval) peers can exchange files, tokens, and think-tasks.
Plaintext HTTP is the default; set `"p2p_use_tls": true` plus
`"p2p_tls_certfile"`/`"p2p_tls_keyfile"` in `~/.cortana/config.json` for TLS
(a self-signed cert is fine on a trusted LAN — generate one with
`generate_self_signed_cert()` from `core.p2p`). Only enable P2P on networks you
trust; API keys requested via `get_token` travel over the P2P transport.

## 📦 Linux code sandbox (opt-in)

The agent's SHELL tool runs commands directly by default. For contained execution
on Linux, set `"code_sandbox": true` in `~/.cortana/config.json`:

- fresh temporary working directory per run, wall-clock timeout, CPU/memory/file-size/process limits, scrubbed environment;
- with **bubblewrap** installed: read-only system mounts and optional network cut-off (`--unshare-net`);
- without it: a restricted-subprocess fallback (limits + temp dir only — honestly **not** a security boundary);
- on macOS/Windows the sandbox reports itself unavailable instead of pretending.

## 🌐 Browser capability (optional, no new dependencies)

`tools/browser.py` fetches pages with the best backend available: Playwright if
installed → system Chromium headless → plain-HTTP text fallback. `fetch_text()`
always works; `screenshot()` and scripted `browse()` need a rendering backend and
say exactly how to install one when missing. The text fallback never claims
JavaScript rendering.

## 🐝 Hive mind, agent swarm, MCP, deep research

- **`/hive <question>`** — asks every connected AI provider the same question
  in parallel and synthesizes one consensus answer with per-model attributions.
  Failed providers are skipped, never faked. Opt-in P2P shared result cache
  (`"hive_cache_sharing": true` in `~/.cortana/config.json`, default off) lets
  peers share cached answers keyed by prompt hash so the swarm doesn't pay
  twice; entries carry model + timestamp and expire via `"hive_cache_ttl"`.
  Peers advertise provider/model *names* only — API keys never go over the wire.
- **`/swarm <task>`** — planner breaks the task down, parallel workers execute
  (bounded, per-worker timeouts), reviewer synthesizes. Code-running workers use
  the Linux sandbox; nothing runs unsandboxed by accident.
- **`/mcp`** — minimal MCP client (stdio, stdlib only): `/mcp servers`,
  `/mcp tools [server]`, `/mcp call <server> <tool> '{"args":…}' [--yes]`.
  Configure servers under `"mcp_servers"` in `~/.cortana/config.json`; tool calls
  from untrusted servers require confirmation unless `--yes` or allow-listed.
- **`/research <topic>`** — multi-query web research: plans sub-queries,
  fetches pages via the browser module, and compiles a Markdown report where
  every `[n]` citation is validated against a fetched source — out-of-range
  citations are stripped, never fabricated. Bounded (4 queries / 8 pages).

## ⏰ Task scheduler

`/schedule` runs persistent jobs inside the Cortana process — no system cron,
no background daemon:

```text
/schedule add --name "nightly pull" --action "/ollama auto-pull" --cron "0 4 * * *"
/schedule add --name "hourly brief" --action "/brief now" --every 3600
/schedule add --name "one report" --action "/research local AI" --at "2026-09-26T09:00:00"
/schedule list        /schedule log
/schedule remove <id>  /schedule run <id>
/schedule pause <id>   /schedule resume <id>
```

Jobs persist in `~/.cortana/scheduler_jobs.json` (atomic writes, mode `0600`)
with an append-only run history in `scheduler_runs.jsonl`. Actions are
whitelisted (`/brief`, `/ollama auto-pull`, `/research`, `/health`, and
`shell: …` executed **only** through the sandbox) — anything else is
rejected. Missed runs are logged honestly; missed one-shot jobs are disabled
rather than silently discarded. The scheduler starts when Cortana enters its
normal interactive mode.

## 🖥️ Web dashboard

`cortana dashboard` (or `/dashboard` inside chat) starts a local web UI —
stdlib `http.server` only, no dependencies:

- binds **loopback (`127.0.0.1`) by default**; `--lan` binds all interfaces
  with an explicit warning;
- per-instance random token stored at `~/.cortana/dashboard_token` (`0600`),
  sent as `?token=` or the `X-Cortana-Token` header, compared with
  `hmac.compare_digest`;
- live panels read real state: providers, P2P peers, Ollama hosts/models,
  scheduler jobs + recent runs, brief watcher, and a redacted log tail;
- chat posts to `core.brain.think`; a read-only command whitelist
  (`/health`, `/models`, `/schedule list`, `/schedule log`, `/ollama ps`,
  `/ollama stats`, `/brief status`, `/p2p-status`) — nothing else executes.

Flags: `--port 0` (random free port), `--open`, `--lan`.

## 🦙 Ollama fleet management

```text
/ollama ps          list hosts and their models
/ollama pull <m>    pull a model on every reachable host
/ollama prune       remove unused models (confirms first)
/ollama bench       quick throughput benchmark per host
/ollama stats       usage telemetry recorded by chat sessions
/ollama auto-pull   pull configured models everywhere (great with /schedule)
/connect ollama --host http://other:11434   add hosts to the pool
```

Down servers and missing models report one actionable line
("Couldn't reach Ollama … start it with `ollama serve`",
"Ollama doesn't have model '…' — pull it with `/ollama pull …`")
instead of a traceback or a silent cloud fallback.

## 🧊 Thin client

`/thin` turns a low-resource node into a thin client: the chat UI runs
locally while heavy work is forwarded to a reachable fat peer. If no peer
is reachable it says so plainly instead of pretending.

## ⏳ Conversation time-travel

```text
/rewind [n]        step back n turns (default 1)
/branch <name>     fork the conversation here
/branches          list branches
/diff [a] [b]      show what changed between turns/branches
```

## 📦 Skill sharing

`/skill` installs skill packs shared by other Cortana nodes. Every pack is
manifest-verified before anything runs — unverified content is refused,
never executed.

## 📋 Proactive briefs & 🤝 session handoff

```text
/brief now         "while you were away" brief on demand
/brief status      watcher state
/handoff <peer>    hand this live session to another node
```

## 🛠 Dev mode

For the developer's own machine only — diagnostics and visibility, no behavior changes:

```bash
export CORTANA_DEV_MODE=1   # or set "dev_mode": true in ~/.cortana/config.json
```

When enabled: DEBUG logging, per-request timing with the serving provider/model in the logs, and a `🛠 DEV MODE` banner at REPL startup so it's visually obvious this isn't the public build.

Optional personal instructions: create `~/.cortana/dev_instructions.md` with your own notes — they're appended to the system prompt in dev mode. The file lives **outside the repo** (in your home directory) and is never committed; dev mode works fine without it.
